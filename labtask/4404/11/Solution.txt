The problem asks us to figure out the shortest distance between the first node and he last node.
The special condition here is that, we need a necessary amount of energy to go from one node to another and in each node we have a infinite supply of foods which replenishes our energy bar.
Meaning When we reach a node we will refigure the weight ofthe node by this equation: 
    weight= energy required-energy gain.
Following this equation, we can figure out that the weights of the node can be negetive and there may even be a negetive weight cycle.
To find the shortest distance from node 1 to the last one we need to apply the bellman ford algorithm.
But in case of negetive weight cycle in the grap, we cant find any shortest path using any algorithm. On those cases, the problem would be unsolvable.
