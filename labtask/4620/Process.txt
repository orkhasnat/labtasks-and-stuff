.More Updates To Come

INSTRUCTIONS:
	First check if the COM port is connected physically.
	Only the port COM1-4 are available to use the Kit.
	Next use the batch file to generate the the necessary files. We would want to run the <TO_BE_ADDED_LATER> file
	Run the WinMDA-8086 program.
	Change the Kit to Serial Monitor(PC) mode.
	Press the RESET button. It will modify the prompt in the program.
	Now press 'L' and when the prompt says 'Downloading' or something like that press PgUp button.
	Now provide the file path.
	The downloading will be complete.

	Now change the Kit to Machine Mode.
	Press RESET again in case of any problems.

	Pressing GO is supposed to work now.



BEWARE:
	1. The file must not have any numbers in it. It mostly follows C like filenames. But stick to lowercase names.
	2. Also the file name should not be larger than six characters :)
	3. Remember to change from PC mode to Monitor mode after uploading.
	4. Remember to use the correct ports. Otherwise it would not work. More on that in the future.
